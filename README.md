# Data-Fetch-From-JSON
•	I have used jQuery to complete my task .The jQuery code uses getJSON() method to fetch the data from the   file’s location using an AJAX HTTP GET request.
•	It takes two arguments. One is the location of the JSON file and the other is the function containing the JSON data.
•	The each() function is used to iterate through all the objects in the array. It also takes two arguments. One is the data and the other one is the function containing the index and the element. An empty string is used to construct rows that contain the data from the JSON objects.The append() method is used to append the string containing rows in the table.
